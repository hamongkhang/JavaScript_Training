  // Does any inventor have the letter 'y' in their name?

  
  // Does every inventor have the letter 'e' in their name?
 
  
  // Does every inventor have first name that's longer than 4 characters?

  
  /////////////////filter////////////////////////////////////
  // Print out an array of the inventors whose name starts with 'A'.

  
  // Print out an array of the inventors whose name contains 'n'.

  
  // Print out an array of the inventors whose name has the same letter twice in a row (e.g. nn or mm).


  // Print out an array of the numbers which are odd.

  
  // Print out an array of the numbers that have two digits.

  
  // Print out an array of the numbers which are prime.

  
  /////////////////MAP/////////////////////////
  // Print out the first name of each inventor.


  // Print out the length of every inventor's full name.

  
  // Print out initials of all inventors(e.g. A.E., I.N., ...)

  
  // Print out an array of every number multiplied by 100.

  
  ////////////////////find/findIndex///////////////////////
  // Find the inventor that has a middle name.

  
  // Bonus: Return a new array, that only has inventors without a middle name. (Hint: think about splice, if you use findIndex. But you may also use another of the methods you've learned about above.)


  // Find the number divisible by 7.

  // task 1: Given a string, Write a function to reverse each word in the sentence


// task 2: Write a recursive function to reverse the string.


// task 3: Given an array, Write a function to reverse the items in that array.


// task 4: write a recursive function that reverses an array


// task 5: write a recursive sum function


// task 6: Write a recursive function to know if a number is prime


// task 7: Write a class that includes 4 methods: add, update, remove, compare
